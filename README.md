# Scripts to classify geochemical data from the Columbia River Basalts

This directory contains supervised and unsupervised classification models developed for whole rock geochemical data of the Columbia River Flood Basalts (CRFB) in Hampton and Karlstrom (2025) GSA (submitted), as well as in-development code for other related machine learning research. 

To access the trained logistic regression models for the CRFB navigate to: 

/notebooks/GSA_paper/

and open the python jupyter notebook "Classify_from_trained_CRBmodel.ipynb". This will load the files in:

/data/CRB

and utilize trained MLR models in:

/data/CRB/trained_models

Gaussian mixture model plotting scripts from Hampton and Karlstrom (2025) can also be found in the /notebooks/GSA_paper folder.

Note that development code is contained in /notebooks/Dev.
